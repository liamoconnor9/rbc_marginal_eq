abstract = {In this paper a theoretical investigation is made of various properties of the steady-state inhomogeneous turbulent convection
of heat in a fluid between horizontal conducting surfaces. An upper limit to the heat transport is found subject to the constraint
that some minimum eddy size exists which is effective in this transport. The spectrum of convecting motions, the mean thermal
gradients at each point and the eddy conductivity are then determined in terms of the minimum eddy size. The relation between
the boundary conditions and eddy size is studied by an extension of the work of Pellew & Southwell using the mean thermal
gradients deduced when n$_{0}$ modes of motion are present to establish the Rayleigh number at which the (n$_{0}$ + 1)th mode
first becomes unstable. In a final section the spectra and mean-square values of the fluctuating velocity and temperature
fields are estimated from the Boussinesq form of the hydrodynamic equations. The previously reported experimental heat transports
are within 10% of those predicted. The discrete transitions are within the error limits of the observations. However, further
data must be gathered to justify the use of minimum eddy size as a defining parameter in situations of geophysical scale.},

  title = {The solar dynamo},
  volume = {11},
  year = {2003},
  abstract = {The solar dynamo continues to pose a challenge to observers and theoreticians. Observations of the solar surface reveal a magnetic field with a complex, hierarchical structure consisting of widely different scales. Systematic features such as the solar cycle, the butterfly diagram, and Hale's polarity laws point to the existence of a deep-rooted large-scale magnetic field. At the other end of the scale are magnetic elements and small-scale mixed-polarity magnetic fields. In order to explain these phenomena, dynamo theory provides all the necessary ingredients including the
  $\alpha$
  effect, magnetic field amplification by differential rotation, magnetic pumping, turbulent diffusion, magnetic buoyancy, flux storage, stochastic variations and nonlinear dynamics. Due to advances in helioseismology, observations of stellar magnetic fields and computer capabilities, significant progress has been made in our understanding of these and other aspects such as the role of the tachocline, convective plumes and magnetic helicity conservation. However, remaining uncertainties about the nature of the deep-seated toroidal magnetic field and the
  $\alpha$
  effect, and the forbidding range of length scales of the magnetic field and the flow have thus far prevented the formulation of a coherent model for the solar dynamo. A preliminary evaluation of the various dynamo models that have been proposed seems to favor a buoyancy-driven or distributed scenario. The viewpoint proposed here is that progress in understanding the solar dynamo and explaining the observations can be achieved only through a combination of approaches including local numerical experiments and global mean-field modeling.},

title = "A validated non-linear kelvin-helmholtz benchmark for numerical hydrodynamics",
abstract = "The non-linear evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a popular test for code verification. To date, most Kelvin-Helmholtz problems discussed in the literature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution with increasing resolution. This precludes comparisons among different codes and severely limits the utility of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as a test problem. The lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert the accuracy of their simulations based on ad hoc proxies, e.g. the existence of small-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz problems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion.We show that in many cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in Kelvin-Helmholtz problems.We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution using both ATHENA, a Godunov code, and DEDALUS, a pseudo-spectral code. Problems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively straightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump (which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behaviour and are more computationally challenging. In the latter case, ATHENA simulations are prone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is seeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as resolution increases. Both ATHENA and DEDALUS exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid simulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which induce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. Our results highlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstrated convergence to a reference solution. To facilitate future comparisons, we include as supplementary material the resolved, converged solutions to the Kelvin-Helmholtz problems in this paper in machine-readable form.",

abstract = {Geodynamo models depend on two important parameters: the Ekman and Rayleigh numbers. While the difficulty of simulating a geodynamo with very small Ekman number has been widely discussed, the Rayleigh number has received relatively little attention. The energy budget is rather tight, giving hope for a low Rayleigh number and a tractable problem. Entropy considerations constrain the Rayleigh number to be large and positive. In the special case when the conduction profile in the absence of convection has the same functional dependence on radius as the adiabatic temperature, the Rayleigh number is simply related to the entropies of magnetic and thermal diffusion. In general, the Earth’s core may be stirred by both thermal and compositional convection, and may contain distinct stable regions where no convection occurs, but the same entropy argument holds and at least one of the Rayleigh numbers must be large and positive in at least one of the convecting regions. For molecular diffusivities, the Rayleigh number is enormous, 1029 for thermal convection and 1038 for compositional convection. Turbulent diffusivities give much lower values, 1012 for thermal and 1015 for compositional convection, or 103 and 106 times the critical Rayleigh number for magnetoconvection in a strong magnetic field. These values exceed the critical Rayleigh number for non-magnetic convection, which is higher than for magnetoconvection by a factor of 103 for turbulent diffusivities and 105 for molecular values. Convection in the Earth’s core could persist even when the geomagnetic field becomes weak, for example during excursions or polarity reversal. The turbulent value for thermal convection is low enough to be reached in numerical simulations in the near future.}

title = {Multiple scales analysis of slow-fast quasi-linear systems},
volume = {475},
year = {2019},
abstract = {This article illustrates the application of multiple scales analysis to two archetypal quasi-linear systems; i.e. to systems involving fast dynamical modes, called fluctuations, that are not directly influenced by fluctuation-fluctuation nonlinearities but nevertheless are strongly coupled to a slow variable whose evolution may be fully nonlinear. In the first case, fast waves drive a slow, spatially inhomogeneous evolution of their celerity field. Multiple scales analysis confirms that, although the energy
, the angular frequency
and the modal structure of the waves evolve, the wave action
/
is conserved in the absence of forcing and dissipation. In the second system, the fast modes undergo an instability that is saturated through a feedback on the slow variable. A new multi-scale analysis is developed to treat this case. The key technical point, confirmed by the analysis, is that the fluctuation energy and mode structure evolve slowly to ensure that the slow field remains in a state of near marginal stability. These two model systems appear to be generic, being representative of many if not all quasi-linear systems. In each case, numerical simulations of both the full and reduced dynamical systems are performed to highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the multiple scales approach. Python codes are provided as electronic supplementary material.},
