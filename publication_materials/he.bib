 abstract = {In this paper a theoretical investigation is made of various properties of the steady-state inhomogeneous turbulent convection of heat in a fluid between horizontal conducting surfaces. An upper limit to the heat transport is found subject to the constraint that some minimum eddy size exists which is effective in this transport. The spectrum of convecting motions, the mean thermal gradients at each point and the eddy conductivity are then determined in terms of the minimum eddy size. The relation between the boundary conditions and eddy size is studied by an extension of the work of Pellew & Southwell using the mean thermal gradients deduced when n0 modes of motion are present to establish the Rayleigh number at which the (n0 + 1)th mode first becomes unstable. In a final section the spectra and mean-square values of the fluctuating velocity and temperature fields are estimated from the Boussinesq form of the hydrodynamic equations. The previously reported experimental heat transports are within 10% of those predicted. The discrete transitions are within the error limits of the observations. However, further data must be gathered to justify the use of minimum eddy size as a defining parameter in situations of geophysical scale.},

title = "A validated non-linear kelvin-helmholtz benchmark for numerical hydrodynamics",
abstract = "The non-linear evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a popular test for code verification. To date, most Kelvin-Helmholtz problems discussed in the literature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution with increasing resolution. This precludes comparisons among different codes and severely limits the utility of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as a test problem. The lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert the accuracy of their simulations based on ad hoc proxies, e.g. the existence of small-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz problems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion.We show that in many cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in Kelvin-Helmholtz problems.We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution using both ATHENA, a Godunov code, and DEDALUS, a pseudo-spectral code. Problems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively straightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump (which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behaviour and are more computationally challenging. In the latter case, ATHENA simulations are prone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is seeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as resolution increases. Both ATHENA and DEDALUS exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid simulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which induce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. Our results highlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstrated convergence to a reference solution. To facilitate future comparisons, we include as supplementary material the resolved, converged solutions to the Kelvin-Helmholtz problems in this paper in machine-readable form.",

abstract = {Geodynamo models depend on two important parameters: the Ekman and Rayleigh numbers. While the difficulty of simulating a geodynamo with very small Ekman number has been widely discussed, the Rayleigh number has received relatively little attention. The energy budget is rather tight, giving hope for a low Rayleigh number and a tractable problem. Entropy considerations constrain the Rayleigh number to be large and positive. In the special case when the conduction profile in the absence of convection has the same functional dependence on radius as the adiabatic temperature, the Rayleigh number is simply related to the entropies of magnetic and thermal diffusion. In general, the Earth’s core may be stirred by both thermal and compositional convection, and may contain distinct stable regions where no convection occurs, but the same entropy argument holds and at least one of the Rayleigh numbers must be large and positive in at least one of the convecting regions. For molecular diffusivities, the Rayleigh number is enormous, 1029 for thermal convection and 1038 for compositional convection. Turbulent diffusivities give much lower values, 1012 for thermal and 1015 for compositional convection, or 103 and 106 times the critical Rayleigh number for magnetoconvection in a strong magnetic field. These values exceed the critical Rayleigh number for non-magnetic convection, which is higher than for magnetoconvection by a factor of 103 for turbulent diffusivities and 105 for molecular values. Convection in the Earth’s core could persist even when the geomagnetic field becomes weak, for example during excursions or polarity reversal. The turbulent value for thermal convection is low enough to be reached in numerical simulations in the near future.}
