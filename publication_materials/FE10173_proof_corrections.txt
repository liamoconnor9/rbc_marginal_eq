Redline Edits; Please make the following changes before publication:

Specific Questions and Comments to Address for This Paper:

1 Physical Review discourages claims of priority. For more information regarding the change
to the following sentence and others like it, Please see http://publish.aps.org/authors/newnovel-policy-physical-review.

Assuming no further action is required by the authors, the page proof edits are acceptable. 

2 Please add a sentence or two explaining your table in Appendix C, as we prefer not to include Appendixes consisting of only tables or figures and no text.

Append the following after line 442:

Table 1 provides control parameters and dependent MSTE properties. High-Ra cases require increased resolutions and run times due to their decreased boundary layer thicknesses and the appearance high-kx marginal modes. 

3 The citation of Table 1 is missing in the text. Please cite the same in running text in sequence to avoid the renumbering of floating elements.

Replace line 140 with the following:

The necessary number of basis functions increases with Ra as the eigenfunctions include increasingly small-scale features (see Appendix C Table 1 and Appendix D).

4 Please verify page no. in Ref. [23].

The number 475 refers to the Journal volume. Please omit any page numbers as they do not appear to be provided by the Journal.
